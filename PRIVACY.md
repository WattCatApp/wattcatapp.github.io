# WattCat Privacy Policy
*Last updated 2020-05-14*

Your privacy is important and you should always know what happens with your data. This privacy policy is short and you should read it in full.

WattCat as a mobile app acts as a gateway between the user and the JLR InControl web service. WattCat provides a way for the user to communicate with InControl and nothing else.

By using WattCat, the Jaguar InControl service will receive some personal information from you, including the device you're using and your IP address. Please refer to the [InControl privacy policy](https://incontrol.jaguar.com/jaguar-portal-owner-web/about/privacy-policy) for more information on how Jaguar handles that information.

WattCat does not pass any data on to any other party except the JLR InControl Service.

Your login credentials are encrypted with AES256 using the Android key store and stored securely on the device.

WattCat does not incorporate any third party analytics or user tracking.
