## WattCat

InControl app (I-Pace only) for Android

### What is it

WattCat is an Android app that uses the InControl API to present vehicle information and enable the user to interact with the vehicle. 

### Why use it

It's significantly faster than the official InControl remote app and offers numerous functional advantages.

- A more sensible, responsive and consistent UI. By making the most critical information and commands available immediately when the user opens up the app, you don't have to swipe and tap to get the information you need. A more Material Design compliant responsive UI provides a visually pleasing user experience.
- Exclusive features
- Privacy oriented and secure: No user tracking, analytics, crashlytics or ads of any kind. All data stored at rest is encrypted using the Android keystore with AES 256 bit.
